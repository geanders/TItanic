\header{Description}

Statistical machine learning has became the central tool for a large number of research and practical fields, such as business decision making, imaging processing, and detecting disease relevant factor, and particularly predictive modeling. A vast amount of statistical tools and models have been discussed in literature for predictive modeling from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. In this course, instead of focusing on the theoretical aspects, students will gain extensive practice in building and testing predictive models through directed participation in predictive modeling competitions, including Kaggle (\url{https://www.kaggle.com/}) and the Data Mining Cup (\url{http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/}). Competitions will include predicting responses of mixed types. Practical utilization of statistical learning tools will be discussed along with the competition. In addition, students will gain extensive practice in using R
software for data wrangling and modeling. 


\header{Prerequisites}

\header{Course Objectives}

The primary aim of this course is to use three in-depth, practical
examples of predictive-modeling challenges (two Kaggle competitions
and the Data Mining Cup) to allow students to gain extensive practical
experience in data processing, data matrix construction, variable selection, model fitting, model ensemble, and evaluating predictive
models. With that aim, this course will introduce students to a
variety of topics in machine learning to provide them with strategies
and approaches to tackle these specific applied examples. Some of the
challenges that will come up will be specific to these three problems,
but this experience of completing three predictive modeling
competitions will provide students with the conceptual understanding, programming tools, and
strategies to tackle their own predictive modeling challenges. This
course would also provide an excellent background for students aiming
to take more theoretical courses on statistical learning in the
future. 
\vspace{.2cm}

Specific objectives include: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Students will work in multi-disciplinary teams to compete in the two Kaggle predictive modeling competitions.
\item Students will learn how to fit and evaluate a variety of
  predictive models, including: classification and regression trees,
  support vector machines, logistic and linear regression models,
  tree ensemble models, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, and neural networks.
\item Students will learn strategies in data wrangling and feature engineering to improve
  predictive models.
\item Students will learn to use resampling methods to assess the
  performance of predictive models.
\item Students will gain extensive additional experience working on
  complex modeling problems using R statistical software. 
  \item Students will be recommend to form a team to participate the annual Data Mining Cup held from April to May. The final result will be released on July 2016, and the top 10 teams will be invited to Berlin, Germany, for the final ceremony; more details see \url{http://www.data-mining-cup.de/en/}, \url{http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2013/10/01/iowa-state-dmc/}.
